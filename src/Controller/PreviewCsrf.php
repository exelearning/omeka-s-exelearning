/**
 * Long-lived CSRF token for the editor preview management API (serving
 * contract v2, managementHeaders['X-CSRF-Token']).
 *
 * The editor creates ONE preview session at bootstrap and then issues MANY
 * preview publish POSTs across the whole editing session. Laminas' default form
 * CSRF token (Laminas\Form\Element\Csrf, as used by the save endpoint) is
 * unsuitable for that lifecycle:
 *
 *  - The token is NOT single-use — Laminas\Validator\Csrf::isValid() is a pure
 *    comparison against the session token list; it never consumes or rotates
 *    the token — so a single token can validate unlimited publishes.
 *  - BUT initCsrfToken() stamps an ABSOLUTE, container-GLOBAL
 *    `EXPIRE = time() + timeout` (default timeout 300s) on the validator's
 *    session namespace and never refreshes it on validation. So a token minted
 *    at editor load stops validating ~5 minutes later and every later publish
 *    403s. Because that EXPIRE is container-global, any co-namespaced token with
 *    a finite timeout (e.g. the save form's, also named "csrf") would wipe the
 *    whole namespace when it lapses.
 *
 * This mints the preview token in its OWN namespace ({@see NAME}) with
 * `timeout => null` (no absolute expiry → survives for the authenticated
 * session), isolating it from the form-token namespace's 5-minute expiry so a
 * long editing session keeps previewing. It is defense-in-depth only: the
 * management API additionally requires a logged-in identity and owner-scoped
 * session access.
 *
 * Minting AND validation go through the single {@see validator()} factory so
 * their options (name + `timeout => null`) can never drift apart — a validator
 * with a divergent name would look in the wrong session namespace, and a
 * divergent finite timeout would re-introduce the container-global expiry this
 * class exists to avoid.
